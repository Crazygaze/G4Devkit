### What's G4 ###

G4 is the code name for the game I'm working on, inspired by Notch's [0x10c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0x10c).

One of the key components of the game is the existence of in-game computers that the players will be able to program to help them out.
Since not all players will have the will or perhaps the skill to code their own things, a default Operating System is provided that will be able to perform all basic activities.
