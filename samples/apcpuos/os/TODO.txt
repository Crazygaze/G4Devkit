------------------------
Doesn't work properly if the specified range starts and finished with a valid
page, but inbetween pages are invalid. It only checks the first and last page.
If I add a CPU instruction to check an address, change the function to suport it


-----------------
- Refactor thread creation, so there is only one function creating both the main
thread and secondary threads. At the moment a process's main thread is created
with one function, and secondaries in another. Is is bug prone, as any thread
changes I need to make, I need to change both functions


- Change hw_HwiData to have only the required registers
