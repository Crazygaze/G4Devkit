# What is this library

This library provides the bare minimum code to display something to the screen
and print to the debug output.

Since the intention is to be simple, it doesn't expose the entire feature set of
any of the hardware devices or the architecture for that matter.

For the full architecture's full feature set, consult the technical
documentation.
